Creat a Car class and add all methods a car can have
example method properties are car make, model, color are attributes
example add speed/accelerate, brake, start ,stop, lightsonoff, turn left right etc
use global variable and use user inputs on a console application to interact with car
display the car status of all this values as they change
ask user to build a car of what they want and then as questions to increase speed or decrease speed
turns ligths etc.
At this point its all console but can improve by using pygame later
